<p>My name is Morgan Chastain, I am 29 years old. I am originally from Greensboro, North Carolina.  I moved back to the DC metro area about two years ago. I went to college at East Carolina University for an undersgraduate degree in Healthcare Administration.  I went back to school to obtain a Master's degree in Health Informatics.  I am currently working as a Systems Analyst at a non- profit Pediatric Clinic in Fairfax.  Before I was an Analyst I was a software trainer at Inova in Falls Church.  I taught end users the Epic EMR system.</p>
